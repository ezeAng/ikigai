# Ikig.ai

The Ikigai Web App is a tool designed to help users discover their Ikigai, a Japanese concept that combines four elements: what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. It guides users through a series of form inputs, utilizing the OpenAI API to provide personalized insights and suggestions.

## How it Works

The Ikigai Web App uses the OpenAI API to analyze user responses and generate personalized recommendations based on the four aspects of Ikigai. Users are prompted to answer a series of questions related to their interests, skills, passions, and values. The app then processes this information to suggest potential paths and activities that align with their Ikigai.
